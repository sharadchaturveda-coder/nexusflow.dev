# CSS Layout Bug Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

The persistent layout bug, which causes a large empty space below the `InteractiveSalesAgent` component on mobile devices, is caused by the `gap-12` Tailwind CSS class within the `FeatureStory` component. This class applies a large vertical gap between the feature description and the `InteractiveSalesAgent` component in the single-column mobile view.

## 2. Investigation Details

### 2.1. File Analysis

The following files were analyzed as per the request:
- [`pages/index.tsx`](pages/index.tsx): The parent page where the components are assembled.
- [`components/home/FeatureStory.tsx`](components/home/FeatureStory.tsx): The direct wrapper component for `InteractiveSalesAgent`.

### 2.2. Component Hierarchy

- In [`pages/index.tsx`](pages/index.tsx:54), the `<InteractiveSalesAgent />` is passed as the `visual` prop to the `<FeatureStory />` component.
- This confirms that `FeatureStory` is the immediate parent container responsible for the layout of the `InteractiveSalesAgent` and its surrounding elements.

### 2.3. CSS Analysis and Root Cause Identification

The root cause was located in [`components/home/FeatureStory.tsx`](components/home/FeatureStory.tsx).

The key element is the `motion.div` on **line 38**:

```tsx
<motion.div
  className={`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-center ${
    reverse ? 'md:grid-flow-col-dense' : ''
  }`}
  // ...props
>
```

**Analysis of Tailwind Classes:**

1.  **`grid`**: This class establishes a CSS grid layout.
2.  **`grid-cols-1`**: This is the default class for screen sizes smaller than the `md` breakpoint. It forces the grid to have only **one column**, stacking the child elements (the text content and the visual component) vertically.
3.  **`md:grid-cols-2`**: At the medium breakpoint and above, the layout switches to two columns, placing the elements side-by-side. This is why the bug is not present on desktop.
4.  **`gap-12`**: This class applies a `3rem` (or `48px`) gap between grid rows and columns.
    *   On **desktop** (`md` screens and up), this creates a horizontal gap between the two columns.
    *   On **mobile** (single-column view), this same class creates a **vertical gap** between the stacked grid items. This is the direct cause of the large empty space.
5.  **`items-center`**: This class aligns the items in the center of their grid area, which could slightly exacerbate the issue if the grid rows have extra height, but the primary cause of the space is the `gap-12`.

## 3. Conclusion

The layout bug is not within the `InteractiveSalesAgent` component itself but is a direct result of the parent `FeatureStory` component's styling. The `gap-12` class, intended for a two-column desktop layout, is incorrectly creating a large vertical space on mobile devices where a single-column layout is active.

## 4. Recommendation for Resolution

A developer should apply a responsive gap utility to the `motion.div` in [`components/home/FeatureStory.tsx`](components/home/FeatureStory.tsx:38). For example, change `gap-12` to `gap-x-12 gap-y-8` or a similar value. This would allow for separate control over the horizontal (`gap-x`) and vertical (`gap-y`) spacing, resolving the issue on mobile without affecting the desktop layout.
