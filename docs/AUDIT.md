# Documentation Audit Report - Nexus Flow AI

This report summarizes the audit of existing documentation and outlines the plan for overhauling and expanding it.

## 1. Audit Existing Documentation

### `README.md` (Main Project Root)

*   **Keep (and adapt for conciseness)**:
    *   Project Name (`# Nexus Flow AI - Full Stack Application`)
    *   One-Sentence Tagline (will be created)
    *   Brief Project Overview (`This is the official repository...`)
    *   Tech Stack Summary (`## Tech Stack`)
    *   Quick Setup (clone, install, dev/run commands - will be moved to `docs/setup.md` and linked)
*   **Rewrite (and integrate into new structure)**:
    *   `Table of Contents`: Will be replaced with an auto-updating TOC linking to the new `docs/*.md` files.
    *   `Overview` and `What is Nexus Flow AI?`: Content is good but too verbose for the main README's 50-line limit. Key points will be condensed for the README, and detailed explanations will be moved to `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/setup.md`.
    *   `Features`: Similar to `Overview`, too detailed for the main README. Key features will be summarized, and details moved to relevant `docs/` files (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/pages.md`).
*   **Remove (from `README.md` to meet line limit, content will be relocated)**:
    *   The extensive descriptions under "Overview," "What is Nexus Flow AI?", and "Features" will be removed from the main `README.md` and distributed into the new, more specific documentation files within the `docs/` directory.

### Existing `docs/` Folder Files

*   **Rewrite (and rename/integrate)**:
    *   `docs/01-getting-started.md`: Content is largely accurate for setup. Will be rewritten, expanded to include env vars and secrets patterns, and renamed to `docs/setup.md`.
    *   `docs/02-folder-structure.md`: Provides a good initial overview of the folder structure. Will be rewritten, potentially integrated into `docs/architecture.md` or kept as a dedicated `docs/folder-layout.md` if needed, and expanded with more context.
    *   `docs/03-component-architecture.md`: Contains valuable information on component structure, styling, and data flow. Will be rewritten, expanded to include styling conventions, and renamed to `docs/components.md`. The dashboard backend integration details will be moved to `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   `docs/04-environment-variables.md`: Very minimal. Content will be integrated into the new `docs/setup.md` with more comprehensive details on required environment variables and secrets patterns.
    *   `docs/05-deployment.md`: Good starting point for deployment. Will be rewritten, expanded to detail the GitHub â†’ Vercel pipeline and branch rules, and renamed to `docs/deployment.md`.
    *   `docs/06-backend-architecture.md`: Excellent, detailed overview of the backend. This content is highly valuable and will be largely kept, rewritten for clarity and conciseness, and integrated into `docs/architecture.md`.
*   **Remove**:
    *   `docs/README.md`: This file is redundant and will be removed. The main project `README.md` will serve as the primary entry point.
    *   The numbered `01-`, `02-` prefixes will be removed from filenames for cleaner organization.

### Inline Comments and Code Annotations

*   **Keep**:
    *   Most inline comments that provide immediate context for specific lines of code, explain temporary removals (`// Temporarily removed`), or highlight configuration details (`// Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side vars`).
    *   JSDoc-like comments for placeholder functions (`lib/companyDataManager.ts`).
    *   Comments in configuration files (`tailwind.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`).
    *   Comments indicating type references (`next-env.d.ts`).
*   **Rewrite**:
    *   Comments that are vague or could be better explained in the new structured documentation. For example, high-level architectural comments that are better suited for `docs/architecture.md`.
*   **Remove (and flag with `// REVIEW:`)**:
    *   Comments that are truly obsolete, redundant, or refer to old logic that has been completely replaced. I will be cautious with these and flag them if they seem truly unnecessary after the new documentation is in place.
    *   Specific examples of comments to review for potential removal:
        *   `pages/api/status/webhooks.ts:8` (`// Since there's no external webhook configured yet, return a placeholder status`) - if webhooks are configured.
        *   `pages/api/user/quota.ts:6` (`// Dummy data for user quota`) - if real quota fetching is implemented.
        *   Similar "dummy data" comments in other `pages/api/dashboard/*` files.
