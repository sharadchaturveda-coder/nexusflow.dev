# Documentation Audit Report - Nexus Flow AI

This report summarizes the audit of existing documentation and outlines the plan for overhauling and expanding it.

## 1. Audit Existing Documentation

### `README.md` (Main Project Root)

*   **Keep (and adapt for conciseness)**:
    *   Project Name (`# Nexus Flow AI: Automate & Enhance Communication`)
    *   Brief Project Overview (`This repository contains the full-stack Next.js application...`)
    *   Tech Stack Summary (`## Tech Stack`)
    *   Deployment Pipeline (`## Deployment Pipeline`)
    *   Known Issues / Roadmap (`## Known Issues / Roadmap`) - This section is valuable for quick overview.
*   **Rewrite (and integrate into new structure)**:
    *   `Table of Contents`: Will be replaced with an auto-updating TOC linking to the new `docs/*.md` files.
    *   `Quick Setup`: Content is good but will be moved to `docs/setup.md` and linked.
    *   `Core Folder Layout`: Content is good but will be moved to `docs/architecture.md` or `docs/folder-layout.md` and linked.
*   **Remove (from `README.md` to meet line limit, content will be relocated)**:
    *   The extensive descriptions under "Overview," "What is Nexus Flow AI?", and "Features" (if they existed in a previous version) will be removed from the main `README.md` and distributed into the new, more specific documentation files within the `docs/` directory.

### Existing `docs/` Folder Files

*   **Keep**:
    *   [`docs/architecture_dossier.md`](docs/architecture_dossier.md): Comprehensive and detailed. This should be the primary source for architectural deep dives.

    *   [`docs/hooks/useUsageTotals.md`](docs/hooks/useUsageTotals.md): Clear hook documentation.

*   **Rewrite (and rename/integrate)**:
    *   [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md): Good high-level overview, but can be expanded and refined by integrating key insights from `architecture_dossier.md`.
    *   [`docs/components.md`](docs/components.md): Good initial overview. Rewrite, expand to include styling conventions, and keep as `docs/components.md`.
    *   [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md): Good starting point. Rewrite, expand to detail the GitHub â†’ Vercel pipeline and branch rules.
    *   [`docs/future-work.md`](docs/future-work.md): Keep and update as a living document for roadmap and technical debt. Ensure it's regularly reviewed.
    *   [`docs/pages.md`](docs/pages.md): Good initial overview. Rewrite, expand, and keep as `docs/pages.md`.

*   **Remove**:
    *   `docs/AUDIT.md`: This file is the deliverable of this task, so it will be generated.
    *   `docs/README.md`: // REVIEW: `docs/README.md` - Redundant, as the main project `README.md` serves as the primary entry point.

### Inline Comments and Code Annotations

*   **Keep**:
    *   Most inline comments that provide immediate context for specific lines of code.
    *   Comments explaining temporary removals (e.g., `// Temporarily removed`).
    *   Comments highlighting configuration details (e.g., `// Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side vars`).
    *   JSDoc-like comments for placeholder functions or complex logic.
    *   Comments in configuration files (e.g., `tailwind.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`).
    *   Comments indicating type references (e.g., `next-env.d.ts`).
    *   Comments explaining specific API route behavior (e.g., `pages/api/messaging/instagram.ts:6`).
    *   Comments explaining dummy data in API routes that are still in use (e.g., `pages/api/ai/feedback.ts:6`).
    *   Comments explaining specific logic in hooks (e.g., `lib/hooks/useChatLogic.ts:18`).
    *   Comments explaining specific UI behavior (e.g., `components/home/InteractiveSalesAgent.tsx:87`).

*   **Rewrite**:
    *   Comments that are vague or could be better explained in the new structured documentation (e.g., high-level architectural comments that are better suited for `docs/architecture.md`).
    *   Comments that are too verbose for inline context and would be better as part of a dedicated documentation file.

*   **Remove (and flag with `// REVIEW:`)**:
    *   `pages/api/status/webhooks.ts:8` (`// Since there's no external webhook configured yet, return a placeholder status`) - `// REVIEW: Remove if external webhooks are configured and status is dynamic.`
