# State Management

This document outlines the approaches to state management within the application.

## Overview

The application primarily uses React's built-in state management features (useState, useContext) for local and shared component state. For more complex global state, Next.js's data fetching mechanisms and potentially a dedicated state management library (if introduced) are utilized.

## Local Component State

For state confined to a single component, `useState` is the primary hook.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Shared State with Context API

For state that needs to be shared across multiple components without prop drilling, React's Context API is used. This is suitable for themes, user authentication status, or other global configurations.

```tsx
// Example: lib/context/AuthContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, ReactNode } from 'react';

interface AuthContextType {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: any | null; // Replace 'any' with actual user type
  login: (userData: any) => void;
  logout: () => void;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const AuthProvider: React.FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const login = (userData: any) => {
    setIsAuthenticated(true);
    setUser(userData);
  };

  const logout = () => {
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
    setUser(null);
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ isAuthenticated, user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

## Data Fetching and Server-Side State

Next.js provides `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` for fetching data and pre-rendering pages. This data is passed as props to the page components and can be considered initial server-side state.

## Global State Considerations

For more complex global state management patterns (e.g., caching API responses, managing complex forms), a dedicated library like SWR, React Query, or Redux Toolkit might be considered in the future, but are not currently the primary approach.
