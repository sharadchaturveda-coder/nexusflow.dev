# MVP Vision - Project Completion Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the work completed for the "MVP Vision" operation. The primary goal was to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by selecting a subset of features from a larger vision and building them using the existing technology stack.

The project was executed in two main phases, followed by a stabilization period. All planned features were successfully implemented, and critical bugs were resolved. The project is now considered complete from a development standpoint, with a few final actions required from the project stakeholders to deploy the new database schemas.

## 2. Phase 1: "Insight" Features - Implementation Details

This phase focused on delivering tools that provide users with valuable insights and data-driven capabilities.

*   **"ROI & Budget Estimator":** A new tool was created and is accessible at [`/tools/roi-estimator`](pages/tools/roi-estimator.tsx). This feature allows users to estimate potential return on investment based on their inputs. The core calculation logic was clarified and refined during development to ensure accuracy.

*   **"AI Content Generator":** A content generation tool was implemented and is available at [`/tools/content-generator`](pages/tools/content-generator.tsx). It is powered by a new API endpoint, [`/api/generate/content`](pages/api/generate/content.ts), which leverages AI to produce marketing copy and other content for users.

*   **"Smart Alerts" Foundation:** The groundwork for a notification system was laid. The UI was updated on the [`/account`](pages/account.tsx) page to include notification preferences. The backend logic to save these user preferences was implemented via the [`/api/user/notifications`](pages/api/user/notifications.ts) endpoint, preparing the system for future alert-driven features.

## 3. Phase 2: "Control" Features (CRM Simulation) - Implementation Details

This phase focused on simulating core Customer Relationship Management (CRM) functionalities to give users more control over their customer interactions.

*   **Re-branding:** A simple yet impactful UI change was made to re-brand the "Dashboard" to "CRM" in the main navigation, reflecting the new focus of the application. This change was applied to both [`components/NavbarDesktop.tsx`](components/NavbarDesktop.tsx) and [`components/MobileAuthenticatedNavLinks.tsx`](components/MobileAuthenticatedNavLinks.tsx).

*   **"Lead Management" View:** A new page was created at [`/crm/leads`](pages/crm/leads.tsx) to manage leads. This includes a modal for manual lead entry and is supported by the [`/api/crm/leads`](pages/api/crm/leads.ts) API route, which handles the creation and retrieval of lead data.

*   **"WhatsApp Drip Campaign":** A feature for creating and managing automated WhatsApp messaging campaigns was built. The campaign setup UI is located at [`/crm/campaigns`](pages/crm/campaigns.tsx). The core logic for scheduling messages is handled by a new cron job API route at [`/api/cron/send-messages`](pages/api/cron/send-messages.ts).

## 4. Automation and Configuration

To enable the automated sending of WhatsApp messages for the drip campaigns, a Vercel cron job was configured.

*   **Vercel Cron Job:** A [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) file was created and configured to run the message-sending task on a schedule, ensuring that the drip campaigns are executed automatically without manual intervention.

## 5. Bug Fixes and Stabilization

Following the feature implementation phases, a critical build error was identified and resolved.

*   **Build Error Resolution:** The build was failing with the error: `Type error: Cannot find module 'components/ui/switch'`. This was traced to an incorrect import path in [`components/account/NotificationsCard.tsx`](components/account/NotificationsCard.tsx). The path was corrected, the fix was committed, and the changes were pushed to the repository, restoring the build to a healthy state.

## 6. Final Status and Required Actions

All development tasks for the MVP Vision operation are now **complete**. The implemented features are stable and ready for production use.

The following actions are required from the user/team to finalize the deployment:

*   **Database Migrations:** Run database migrations to create the new tables required for the recently implemented features:
    *   `notification_preferences`
    *   `leads`
    *   `campaigns`
    *   `scheduled_messages`
