# Future Work

This document outlines potential future enhancements, features, and areas for improvement for the project.

## High-Priority Items

*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Implement more aggressive image optimization strategies.
    *   Analyze and reduce bundle size.
    *   Optimize data fetching for large datasets.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Improve client-side error reporting and user feedback.
    *   Centralize server-side logging for easier debugging and monitoring.
*   **Accessibility Improvements:**
    *   Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit.
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly.
*   **Testing Coverage:**
    *   Expand unit and integration test coverage for critical components and API routes.
    *   Implement end-to-end tests for core user flows.

## New Features

*   **User Onboarding Flow:** Develop a guided onboarding experience for new users.
*   **Notifications System:** Implement in-app and email notification capabilities.
*   **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:** Add more administrative tools and analytics.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Support multiple languages for a broader audience.
*   **Advanced Search Functionality:** Implement robust search capabilities for content and data.

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

*   **Codebase Cleanup:** Remove unused code, dead styles, and redundant assets.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update third-party libraries and frameworks.
*   **Modularization:** Further break down large components or utility files into smaller, more manageable modules.
*   **Type Safety:** Enhance TypeScript strictness and type definitions across the codebase.

## Research & Exploration

*   **Alternative State Management:** Evaluate more advanced state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) for future scalability.
*   **Serverless Function Optimization:** Explore cold start optimizations and cost reduction strategies for API routes.
*   **AI Model Integration:** Investigate newer AI models or fine-tuning opportunities for improved performance or new capabilities.
