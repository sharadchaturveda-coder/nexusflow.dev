# Future Work

This document outlines upcoming features, known technical debt, and placeholders for future development of the Nexus Flow AI application.

## Upcoming Features / Roadmap

*   **Enhanced User Dashboard**:
    *   Implement real-time updates for usage metrics and activity feeds.
    *   Add more detailed analytics and reporting features (e.g., conversation sentiment, bot performance).
    *   Integrate user feedback directly into the dashboard for easier review.
*   **Advanced Bot Configuration**:
    *   Allow users to upload custom knowledge bases (e.g., PDFs, documents) for their bots.
    *   Provide a UI for fine-tuning bot personas and response styles.
    *   Support for multiple bots per user/account.
*   **Integration with More Messaging Platforms**:
    *   Expand beyond WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram to include platforms like Telegram, Slack, or custom CRM systems.
*   **Subscription Management**:
    *   Implement a full-fledged subscription management system with plan upgrades/downgrades, billing history, and invoice generation.
*   **Admin Panel Improvements**:
    *   Develop a more comprehensive admin interface for user management, content moderation, and system monitoring.

## Technical Debt

*   **Local JSON Data Storage**: The current use of local JSON files (`data/`) for user memory, usage logs, and other critical data is suitable for prototyping but not for production.
    *   **Resolution**: Migrate all persistent data to a robust database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL with Supabase, MongoDB, or a dedicated managed database service). This will improve scalability, reliability, and data integrity.
*   **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance global error handling mechanisms and implement more comprehensive logging across both frontend and backend for better debugging and monitoring.
*   **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, end-to-end tests) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **API Rate Limiting**: While a basic rate limiter is in place, consider more sophisticated strategies (e.g., per-user, per-endpoint limits) and distributed rate limiting for multi-instance deployments.
*   **Code Refactoring**: Review and refactor older or less optimized code sections to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

## Placeholders / To Be Implemented

*   **Live Conversation Component**: The `LiveConversation` component (temporarily removed from `pages/index.tsx`) needs to be re-evaluated and potentially re-implemented with real-time data.
*   **Dashboard Preview Component**: The `DashboardPreview` component (also temporarily removed from `pages/index.tsx`) should be integrated once the dashboard is fully functional and representative.
*   **Comprehensive Environment Variable Documentation**: While `docs/setup.md` covers this, ensure all environment variables are fully documented with their purpose and example values.
*   **Webhook Configuration**: Fully configure and document external webhooks for messaging platforms.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**: Complete the integration with Razorpay or other payment gateways, including handling all webhook events and edge cases.
